# Analytics

Analytics help you evaluate the effectiveness of your documentation, as well as prioritize future efforts.

That being said, documentation analytics are difficult because the reasons *why* users reference docs are diffuse:

- If a page has a lot of pageviews, does that mean it's successful? Or that the product UX is bad?
- If you have a page rating feature, do a lot of negative reviews mean the page is bad? Or that your users wish it was included in a lower plan?
- If an error troubleshooting page gets a lot of search traffic, is it helping customers? Or is your error message unclear? Or is there an incident related to that product?
