# Measure success

Though essential to your success, the "success" of documentation is surprisingly hard to measure.

This difficulty comes from the diffuse reasons a user might approach your docs. Take the following situations as examples, where the same behavior could mean two totally different things.

| Situation | Reason #1 | Reason #2 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| A troubleshooting page has high SEO traffic | Well written and structured documentation | Unclear error message from your API or dashboard |
| New feature docs have a lot of pageviews and a longer average time on page | Valuable documentation | Bad product UX |
| Enterprise-only feature docs have negative ratings | Inaccurate or unhelpful documentation | User wishes they could access the feature without an Enterprise plan. |

Because of this difficulty, you need to think carefully about what success truly means for your docs, as well as how that success might be reflected in [different signals](/docs-guide/manage-content/measure-success/signals/).
