# Internal search

Internal search data measures the queries, clicks, and other search events that happen within your docs.

## Why we like it

This data tells you what folks are looking for in your docs, as well as where they were looking for it.

## How we track it

We track this data using the built-in analytics included with our [Algolia DocSearch implementation](https://docsearch.algolia.com/).
