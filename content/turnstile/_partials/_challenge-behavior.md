If your hostname is proxied through Cloudflare, visitors may experience challenges on your webpages. 

Cloudflare issues these challenges through the [Challenge Platform](/waf/reference/cloudflare-challenges/), which is the same underlying technology powering Turnstile.

In contrast to our Challenge page offerings, Turnstile allows the customer to run challenges anywhere on their site in a less-intrusive way without requiring the use of Cloudflareâ€™s CDN.
