# UI elements

In describing UI, we typically describe what the users need to do without focusing on the UI elements (the interactive parts we use to build the products). However, sometimes to clarify the instructions, you may need to speak to those elements. Below are the prefered terms for elements.

## Symbols in UI element names

### Icons or non-alphabetic characters

Button names and the labels of other UI elements may include icons or symbols that are not alphabetical or numerical. For example, a button named **+ Add element** starts with a plus sign. When writing these names or labels in procedural instructions, do not include these symbols. They are usually redundant and can be safely removed.

Possible exceptions:

- The button has no text other than the symbol (For example, just `+`).
  - Keep the symbol in the instructions.

- The button has no text other than the symbol and the instructions are for the UI of a third-party product.
  - Keep the symbol in the instructions.

### Ellipses

An ellipsis is a set of three dots (`...`) that might be used as a variable or wildcard. For example, a **Save As...** menu item might display a dialog box where you can save a file in different places. If you refer to a menu item or button that has ellipses, do not include the ellipsis. Always leave it out. In text, ellipses can be distracting.
