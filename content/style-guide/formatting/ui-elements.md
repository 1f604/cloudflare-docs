# UI elements

In describing UI, we typically describe what the users need to do without focusing on the UI elements (the interactive parts we use to build the products). However, sometimes to clarify the instructions, you may need to identify elements by name.

| UI element                                                | Usage                                                                                                                                                                          | Example                                                                              | Visual |
| --------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------ |
| Button                                                    | Do not include the type of UI elements unless it adds clarity.                                                                                                                 | Select **Add a Site**.                                                               |        |
| Checkboxes and radio buttons                              | Do not include the type of UI elements unless it adds clarity.                                                                                                                 | Enable **Set as Default DNS Location**.                                              |        |
| Commands                                                  | Do not include the type of UI elements unless it adds clarity. Follow sentence-style capitalization rules.                                                                     | Go to **File**, then select **Delete**.                                              |        |
| Error message                                             | Use sentence case when referencing error messages in the UI.                                                                                                                   | If you receive the error message `Invalid IP`, start the process from the beginning. |        |
| Menu                                                      | You can use `menu` to make it clear when you are directing users to an option in the navigation or menu bars, or use `Go to`.                                                  | In the menu, go to **Websites**.                                                     |        |
| Tab                                                       | Use the name of the tab to refer to the element. Do not use unless neccesary for clarity.                                                                                      | Go to **Action**.                                                                    |        |
| Toggle                                                    | Describe the interaction, not the toggle. Use `enable` or `disable`.                                                                                                           | Enable **Admin override**.                                                           |        |
| Containers (windows, screens, pages, sections, and cards) | Use sentence case as a generic term for the areas on a screen. `Page` is the preferred term for the generic area on a window, but try to use the title instead of the element. | Refer to your site's traffic statistics for more information.                        |        |

## Symbols in UI element names

### Icons or non-alphabetic characters

Button names and the labels of other UI elements may include icons or symbols that are not alphabetical or numerical. For example, a button named **+ Add element** starts with a plus sign. When writing these names or labels in procedural instructions, do not include these symbols. They are usually redundant and can be safely removed.

If an element has no text other than the symbol (for example, just `+`), you can keep the symbol in the instructions. This especially applies to instructions in UIs of third-party products.

### Ellipses

An ellipsis is a set of three dots (`...`) that might be used as a variable or wildcard. For example, a **Save As...** menu item might display a dialog box where you can save a file in different places. If you refer to a menu item or button that has ellipses, do not include the ellipsis. Always leave it out. In text, ellipses can be distracting.
